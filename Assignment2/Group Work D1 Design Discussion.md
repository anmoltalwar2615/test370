**Main Design Decisions**

Preface: We chose Sabrina’s Individual design (Design-4) as the base UML design for Team Design and modified and changed it based on our team's discussions.

The main commonalities between the final design and the individuals were the main classes for grocery list, item, type, methods, and attributes associated with those classes. The differences were mainly in additional details that needed to be added to the individual designs as well as removing unnecessary details such as foreign, primary keys, a class database specifically for items and reformatting for better readability.

To create the final design, we looked at everyone’s individual designs, discussed what we all had in common and kept those in the final design, using Design 4 as a basis. The differences between each design was reconsidered against the requirements and adjusted to make the final design as complete and readable as possible.

**Summary**

The lessons learned throughout this design process was how to see things from different perspectives to create a more complete design. Our need to accommodate everyone's diverse schedules taught us how important flexibility is. We also discovered that a simpler design not only made our development process smoother but also enhanced comprehension of our work. These experiences highlighted that effective teamwork, adaptability and simplicity are key components to our success, emphasizing the most straightforward solutions.
